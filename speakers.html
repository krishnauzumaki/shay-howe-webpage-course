          <h5>Less Is More: How Constraints Cultivate Growth</h5>

          <p>
            By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive.
            They help us make decisions, creating focus around the problem we
            are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which provides a
            better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable
            asset in times of innovation.

            LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS
          </h5>

          <p>
            Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with
            a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling
            technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
            they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
            focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
            many elements that together comprise a well-told story. With this
            workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and
            expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll
            look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat
            sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
            might look to them for inspiration.
